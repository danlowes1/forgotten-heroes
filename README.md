A website that is marketeted to the non-tech savvy generation who missed out on technology and who bang thier index fingers when they type on a keyboard! The generation are confused about AI, who never plyed video games and who want to remember the old days of footballing legands, war heroes, and 60s 70s and 80s pop music.

The final bar scene, in which Sir John Mills' character finally gets his glass of lager, was used in the 1980's in beer advertisements on television, for Holsten Pils, interspersing comedian Griff Rhys Jones into the original footage, à la Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982), and also around 40 years later in a Carlsberg commercial promoting their lager, colorizing it. This scene was reportedly filmed some weeks after the rest of the film, at Elstree. Real lager had to be used to "look right," and Mills had to drink numerous glasses full until the shots were finished (after 14 takes), and was "a little 'heady'" by the end.
