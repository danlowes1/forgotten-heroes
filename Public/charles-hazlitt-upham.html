      <h1>Charles Hazlitt Upham - The Unbreakable Soldier</h1>
      <p>World War II 1939-1945</p>

        <p>Charles Hazlitt Upham (21 September 1908 â€“ 22 November 1994) was a New Zealand sheep farmer and soldier who became one of only three people ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice for exceptional bravery on the battlefield.</p>
        
        <p>Known for his extraordinary courage, modesty, and relentless determination, Upham repeatedly risked his life to save his comrades during World War II, despite being severely wounded multiple times. His incredible actions in Crete and North Africa became legendary among those who served with him.</p>

        <h1>First Victoria Cross - Battle of Crete</h1>
        <p>Upham was awarded his first Victoria Cross for his actions during the Battle of Crete in May 1941. Over the course of several days, he displayed incredible bravery while leading his platoon against overwhelming German forces.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "He showed superb coolness, great skill, and utter disregard of danger. His leadership and courage inspired all who saw him."
          <br>- Official citation for Upham's first Victoria Cross
        </div>
        
        <p>Despite being wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel and shot in the foot, Upham destroyed numerous enemy positions, often attacking them single-handedly. In one remarkable instance, he neutralized a German machine gun nest by throwing grenades into it despite intense fire. He also carried a wounded soldier to safety while under heavy fire and helped evacuate other wounded comrades.</p>
        
        <h1>Second Victoria Cross - North Africa Campaign</h1>
        <p>Upham earned his second Victoria Cross during the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942. Although suffering from dysentery and still recovering from previous wounds, he led his company in a devastating attack against German positions.</p>
        
        <p>He personally destroyed a German tank and several vehicles with grenades, was shot through the elbow but continued fighting, and despite being severely wounded and unable to move his arm, he continued to lead his men until he collapsed from loss of blood and was evacuated.</p>

        <h1>Capture and POW Experience</h1>
        <p>After receiving treatment for his wounds, Upham returned to his unit but was captured during fighting in July 1942. As a prisoner of war, he made multiple escape attempts, earning a reputation as a troublesome and determined prisoner.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "He was a model of chivalry, a soldier of outstanding courage, leadership and determination. His men would have followed him anywhere."
          <br>- Brigadier James Hargest, Upham's commanding officer
        </div>
        
        <p>His escape attempts were so persistent that he was eventually sent to the infamous Colditz Castle, a high-security prison for persistent escapers. He remained there until the castle was liberated by American forces in April 1945.</p>
        
        <h1>Legacy and Humility</h1>
        <p>After the war, Upham returned to New Zealand and resumed life as a sheep farmer, shunning publicity and rarely speaking about his wartime experiences. He declined offers to use his fame for commercial gain and lived a quiet, modest life.</p>
        
        <p>When asked about his incredible bravery, Upham typically responded that he was just doing his job and that the real heroes were the men who didn't come home. His humility and refusal to capitalize on his military fame made him a beloved figure in New Zealand.</p>
        
        <p>Charles Upham passed away in 1994, but his legacy endures as one of the most decorated soldiers in Commonwealth history and a symbol of extraordinary courage, leadership, and modesty. His story represents the highest ideals of military service without glorification of war itself.</p>
