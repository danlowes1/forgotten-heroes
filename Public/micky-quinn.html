      <h1>Micky Quinn - The Pie-Eating Goal Machine</h1>
      <p>Football 1977-1996</p>

        <p>Michael Quinn (born 2 May 1962) was an English former professional footballer who played as a centre forward, known for his prodigious goal-scoring and even more prodigious appetite for life – and apparently pies.</p>
        
        <p>Born in Liverpool to a boxing family, Micky Quinn's career took him from the lower leagues to the Premier League, lighting up pitches at clubs like Portsmouth, Newcastle United, and Coventry City. With 235 goals in 524 league games, he was a force of nature, but it was his larger-than-life personality, cheeky grin, and ability to laugh at himself that cemented his status as a true cult hero.</p>

        <h1>The Pie Heard Round the World</h1>
        <p>In March 1992, during a heated match between Newcastle United and Grimsby Town, Micky Quinn was on the receiving end of some classic terrace banter. A Grimsby fan, spotting the burly striker's famous physique (around 88kg of pure goal-scoring power), lobbed a meat pie onto the pitch in a cheeky jab at Quinn's weight.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          He's fat, he's round, he scores on every ground!
          <br>- The immortal fan chant for Micky Quinn
        </div>
        
        <p>Instead of ignoring it or throwing it back, Quinn picked up the pie and took a big, defiant bite right there on the field. The crowd erupted, and the chant "Who Ate All the Pies?" was born, forever linked to the mighty Micky.</p>
        
        <h1>A Career of Charisma and Goals</h1>
        <p>This wasn't just a one-off; Quinn's career was peppered with such moments. On his Newcastle debut in August 1989 against Leeds United, he scored four goals in a 4-2 comeback win, including a cheeky penalty after shrugging off the "jinxed" No. 9 shirt.</p>
        
        <p>At Coventry, he kicked off the inaugural Premier League season with a hat-trick against Arsenal at Highbury in a 3-0 thrashing that stunned the Gunners. He even claimed to be the Premier League's "fastest player over a yard," a quip that had fans in stitches.</p>

        <h1>Legacy and Later Life</h1>
        <p>The pie incident propelled Quinn into football folklore, but his cult hero status was built on goals and charisma. At Newcastle, he was the Second Division's top scorer in 1989-90 with 34 league goals, helping drag the club back to prominence amid fan unrest and shirt-burning protests.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          Micky wasn't just a striker; he was a pie-eating, goal-scoring legend who proved you can have your cake and eat it too – preferably mid-match.

        <p>Retiring in 1996 after a stint in Greece with PAOK (where he scored just once but probably ate well), Quinn turned his tales into gold. His 2003 autobiography, cheekily titled *Who Ate All the Pies?*, became a bestseller, packed with stories of birds, booze, betting, and beating defenders.</p>
        
        <p>Today, Quinn is a sought-after after-dinner speaker, regaling audiences with self-deprecating humor. Featured in BBC's *Football Focus* "Cult Heroes" series, Micky Quinn reminds us that football isn't just about six-packs and stats – it's about the big personalities who make the game unforgettable.</p>
