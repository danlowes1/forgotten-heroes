        <h1>See How It Works</h1>
        <p>Forgotten Legends is built with a smart, efficient backend that ensures you get the most interesting information as quickly as possible. Here's a peek behind the curtain at how our "AI Update" feature brings these stories to life.</p>
        
        <div class="demo-section">
            <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
            <p>Look for this button on any hero's page to receive any up-to-date information:</p> 
             <p>One click reveals specific information search engines, such as Google, may not find.</p>

            <h2>The Technology Behind Forgotten Legends</h2>

            <p>The majority of content on this page you see before you has been written by an AI bot. This particular piece of text was written (typed-out on a keyboard) by the human
                who developed this website. </p>
            <p>There are three different levels of explanation below, each with a different focus and level of detail. Feel free to read whichever one suits your interest. 
                These were 3 options that were given as suggestions on how to descripe (sic) how the AI feature works on this site.</p>
            <div class="explanation-card">
                <h3>User-Focused & Magical</h3>
                <p>Forgotten Legends is more than a static archive; it's a living project that gets smarter over time. Here's how we bring these stories to life and keep them updated.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <h4>The Living Legend System</h4>
                    <p>At the bottom of every legend's page, you'll find our <strong>"AI Update"</strong> button. This is your portal to discovering even more about these incredible figures.</p>
                </div>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your Curiosity Fuels Discovery:</strong> When you click the button, our system searches for fresh insights, little-known facts, or recent information about the legend.</li>
                    <!-- <li><strong>Instant Knowledge, Powered by AI:</strong> Behind the scenes, your click sends a secure request to a powerful AI language model. We ask it to dig deeper than a standard search.</li> -->
                    <li><strong>Powered by Google's Gemini:</strong> Your click initiates a secure, real-time query to Google's Gemini model, a state-of-the-art AI. This isn't just a simple search; we leverage Gemini's advanced understanding to surface context and details that typical search engines might miss.</li>
                    <li><strong>A Collective Memory:</strong> To make the system fast and efficient for everyone, we store every new discovery in our database. Most of the time, you're seeing a cached result.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Thrill of the New:</strong> The first time a legend's page is visited, your click is guaranteed to generate a brand-new, unique piece of information.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In short, you're not just reading historyâ€”you're helping us build a richer, more detailed one.</p>

                <h3>Balanced & Clear Explanation</h3>
                <p>This version strikes a good balance, explaining the process clearly without being intimidating. It's perfect for a portfolio as it demonstrates you can articulate technical concepts.</p>

                    <h4>The "AI Update" Button: Your Request for Deeper Knowledge</h4>
                </div>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>You Spark the Search:</strong> On every legend's page, the <strong>"AI Update"</strong> button is your way of asking for moreâ€”more obscure facts, recent news, or hidden details.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Smart Backend Check:</strong> When you click, our system first checks its internal database. To save resources and load information instantly, we heavily rely on cached results.</li>
                    <li><strong>The AI Call (When Needed):</strong> If our database doesn't have fresh data for that legend, the system makes a secure API call to an AI model with a carefully crafted prompt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn and Store for Next Time:</strong> The new information we get back from the AI is immediately stored in our database. The next visitor will benefit from your curiosity.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>This intelligent caching system makes the site fast and responsive, while the occasional AI calls ensure our legends' stories continue to evolve.</p>

                <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                <p>This website is a full-stack application designed to demonstrate efficient data handling and API integration. Here's the technical flow behind the "AI Update" feature.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <h4>Architecture & Data Flow</h4>
                </div>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> A user clicks the "AI Update" button on a legend's profile page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Logic & Caching Layer:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The server first checks the application database for a valid, recently cached AI response.</li>
                            <li><strong>If a valid cache exists:</strong> The data is retrieved from the database and served to the user almost instantly.</li>
                            <li><strong>If the cache is stale/missing:</strong> The process proceeds to the API call.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>External API Integration:</strong> The server constructs a prompt and makes a secure API call to a Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT).</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> The response from the AI API is parsed and then stored in the database with a new timestamp.</li>
                    <li><strong>Response to User:</strong> The newly fetched data is then displayed on the front end.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>This model ensures 99% of user requests are served from the local database, making the site incredibly fast and cost-effective, while still providing dynamic, AI-powered content.</p>

            <h2>The Real Test Drive</h2>

            <p>
                If you scrolled down this far, you probably noticed the **"AI Update"** button right at the top of the page. You may have even given it a click!
            </p>
            <p>
                That button is performing the exact same magical task you see on every legend's dedicated pageâ€”it just randomly chose a hero we've already archived. But what fun is a fixed archive?
            </p>

            <p>
                **Want to try the "AI Update" feature on someone we *haven't* yet covered?** You absolutely can! Give our system a new challenge by enabling the input field below:
            </p>
            
            <div class="custom-legend-toggle my-4">
                <button id="toggleInputButton" class="big-ai-button">
                    Challenge the System!
                </button>
                
                <div id="customInputArea" style="display: none;" class="mt-4 p-4 border border-gray-300 rounded bg-gray-50">
                    <label for="legendNameInput" class="block text-gray-700 font-bold mb-2 text-base">
                        Enter New Legend's Name:
                    </label>
                    <input type="text" id="legendNameInput" placeholder="e.g., Tesla, Yourself, That guy from accounts..."
                        class="big-ai-input">
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <p>
                Once you've entered a name above, go ahead and hit the **"AI Update"** button at the top of the page again to see what it can conjure up. Throw any name at itâ€”literally any name. Try your own name if you like, but be warned: **I can't guarantee anything good will come up!** ðŸ˜…
