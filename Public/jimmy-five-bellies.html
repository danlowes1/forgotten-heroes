The moniker, bestowed upon him by a Sun newspaper journalist in the 1990s, reduced a complex individual to a physical characteristic, creating a public persona that would follow him for decades.</p>

           <div class="sub-headline">
                James "Five Bellies" Gardner (born 1966) is a British personality who earned media attention in the 1990s and early 2000s as the best friend of England international footballer Paul Gascoigne.
           </div>  

        <p>A 2004 article in The Guardian described Gardner as "the only person in Britain famous for being a footballer's mate." He gained notoriety for accompanying Gascoigne during his drinking escapades, with stories of their alleged antics frequently appearing in newspapers.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h1>Relationship with Paul Gascoigne</h1>
        <p>Gardner and Gascoigne met at school at the age of 14, and Gascoigne gave him his nickname "Five Bellies" referring to his obesity. Gardner became a constant companion to Gascoigne during his drinking sessions, and their antics became regular tabloid fodder.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "He was drinking all this whisky, but it was having no effect on him. But you can't tell Paul not to do something, or he'll just do it even worse."
          <br>- Jimmy Gardner on Paul Gascoigne's drinking
        </div>
        
        <p>One notorious case alleged that Gardner withstood a lighter flame being applied to his nose to win a £1,000 bet with Gascoigne, though Gardner states that the flame was Gascoigne's way of waking him from a deep sleep in a bar. Gascoigne once recalled firing at Gardner's bare buttocks with an air gun.</p>
        
        <p>During Gascoigne's time at Rangers, manager Walter Smith banned Gardner from the Ibrox Stadium. According to Archie Knox, when Smith arrived in Rome to sign Gascoigne for Rangers, he found Gascoigne attempting to run Gardner over with a quad bike. Gascoigne had on a previous occasion hit Gardner with his car while driving at 30 mph, having been attempting "just to scare him."</p>

        <h1>Personal Life and Challenges</h1>
        <p>Gardner is from Dunston, Gateshead. He left school with no qualifications and worked as a tarmac layer. He had two sons as of 1998.</p>
        
        <p>In February 1997, Gardner was fined £500 for assault, having punched a Celtic fan in the face at a pub in Houston, Renfrewshire, after an Old Firm game; the sheriff said that there was a sectarian element to the attack.</p>
        
        <p>In August 1999, Gardner was sentenced to six months in prison for drunkenly threatening a group of youths with an unloaded air pistol when they taunted him; radio presenter Chris Evans gave him a character reference in court. Less than 72 hours into his sentence, he was released on bail from HM Prison Durham. Gardner described his imprisonment as a trigger event for him to give up drinking.</p>

        <h1>Later Life and Transformation</h1>
        <p>Gardner was declared bankrupt in 2005. In a remarkable transformation, by 2010 he had shed his weight from a peak of 21 stone (290 lb; 130 kg) to 13 stone (180 lb; 83 kg) due to a drastic change in lifestyle. That year he took part in the Great North Run for the Bobby Robson Foundation, wearing shirt number 555 as a reference to his nickname.</p>
        
        <p>His relationship with Gascoigne remained turbulent over the years. They fell out in 2008 when Gardner aimed to address his friend's rapid weight loss and depression, but reconciled later that year. They fell out again in 2013 after Gardner made a public call for his friend to seek help for his addiction. Gardner has confessed that he searches Gascoigne's name on the Internet every day to check if he is still alive.</p>
        
        <p>Tragically, Gardner's cousin, David Cheek, died of acute alcohol poisoning at the age of 43 on 13 August 1998 during a night out with Gardner and Gascoigne.</p>
