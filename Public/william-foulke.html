  <h1>William Foulke - The Colossus of the Victorian Game</h1>
    <p>Sports Circa 1894 - 1907</p>

      <p>William Henry "Fatty" Foulke (12 April 1874 – 1 May 1916) was an English professional goalkeeper who remains a legendary figure not just for his ability, but for his colossal size and highly eccentric behaviour. Standing over **6 feet 2 inches (1.89m)** and weighing upwards of **22 stone (140 kg)** for much of his career, he was a physical phenomenon in an era when the average male was much smaller.</p>
      <p>A true pioneer, Foulke played for **Sheffield United** for 11 seasons, winning major honours and earning a single cap for **England** in 1897. He also notably served as the **first-ever captain and goalkeeper for Chelsea FC**, where his celebrity status was instrumental in promoting the newly formed club.</p>

<h1>A Dominating Career at Sheffield United</h1>
      <p>Born in Dawley, Shropshire, Foulke was spotted playing for a local village side and signed for **Sheffield United** for a fee of just **£10** in 1894. He quickly established himself as a dominant presence, succeeding the pioneering black footballer Arthur Wharton between the posts.</p>

        "Foulke is no small part of a mountain. You cannot bundle him."
        <br>- C.B. Fry, contemporary sportsman and journalist
      </div>
      
      <p>During his time with "The Blades," Foulke achieved significant success, including winning the **Football League Championship** in the 1897–98 season and two **FA Cups** (1899 and 1902). Despite his bulk, he was surprisingly agile, often praised for his quick reflexes and ability to punch the ball enormous distances down the pitch.</p>
      
      <h1>Chelsea's First Superstar and the Ball Boy Myth</h1>
      <p>In 1905, Foulke made a high-profile move to the newly formed **Chelsea FC** for a fee of **£50**, where he was made the club's first-ever goalkeeper and captain. The directors consciously signed him for his box-office appeal as much as his talent, using his size to draw huge crowds to Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>To further accentuate his intimidating stature, Chelsea reportedly employed two small boys to stand behind his goal. Their job was ostensibly to retrieve the ball, but they also highlighted Foulke's immense size by contrast. This practice is widely, though perhaps apocryphally, credited with being the accidental origin of the modern **ball boy** system in football.</p>

      <h1>Legendary Antics and Temperament</h1>
      <p>Foulke's temperament was as famous as his girth. He was known for occasional outbursts, which included walking off the pitch if he felt his defenders were not trying hard enough, and physically lifting opposing forwards and depositing them into his goal when angered. The most famous incident occurred during the 1902 FA Cup Final against Southampton. After the final whistle of the drawn match, a furious Foulke chased the referee, Tom Kirkham, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be physically restrained by FA officials from wrenching the door off its hinges.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to football, Foulke was an accomplished sportsman, making four first-class appearances for **Derbyshire County Cricket Club** in 1900. Foulke retired in 1907 after a brief spell with **Bradford City** and passed away in 1916 at the age of 42.</p>
