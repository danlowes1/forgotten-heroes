  <h1>About Forgotten Legends</h1>
  
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Forgotten Legends exists to shine a light on the remarkable individuals who made significant contributions to our world but never received the recognition they deserved. In an era of fleeting fame and algorithm-driven attention, we preserve the stories that truly matter.</p>
      <p>We believe history isn't just made by the names in textbooks - it's shaped by countless unsung heroes whose legacies deserve to be remembered.</p>
  
    <h2>How This Project Began</h2>
    <p>The idea for Forgotten Legends came when our founder tried to research Jimmy Glass - the goalkeeper whose last-minute goal saved Carlisle United in 1999. Despite this being one of football's most dramatic moments, comprehensive information was surprisingly hard to find.</p>
    <p>This discovery led to a simple question: <strong>"How many other extraordinary stories are being lost to time?"</strong> Our website is the answer to that question.</p>

    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <h3>Historical Accuracy</h3>
    <p>We rigorously fact-check every story, working with historians and primary sources.</p>

    <h3>Inclusive Perspective</h3>
    <p>We actively seek stories across gender, racial, and cultural lines that traditional history overlooked.</p>

    <h3>Educational Focus</h3>
    <p>Our content is designed to inspire learning and curiosity about the past.</p>
