      <h1>Atlas - The Most Advanced Humanoid Robot</h1>
      <p>Robotics 2025</p>

        <p>Atlas is a bipedal humanoid robot primarily developed by the American robotics company Boston Dynamics.</p>
        <p>It is widely regarded as one of the most dynamic and capable humanoid robots ever created, showcasing unprecedented agility, balance, and mobility. Atlas has demonstrated remarkable abilities including running, jumping, backflips, parkour maneuvers, and complex object manipulation that push the boundaries of what's possible in robotics.</p>

        <p>Atlas utilizes advanced control systems that combine perception, balance, and whole-body mobility. Its sensors include stereo vision and lidar, while the onboard computers handle perception, estimation, and motion planning in real-time to navigate complex environments and perform dynamic tasks.</p>
        
        <h1>Capabilities and Legacy</h1>
        <p>Atlas has demonstrated increasingly sophisticated abilities over the years, from simple walking to completing complex parkour courses, manipulating objects with precision, and even performing choreographed dance routines. These capabilities represent significant advancements in robotics that could eventually lead to robots performing dangerous jobs or assisting in disaster response scenarios.</p>
        
        <p>While Atlas remains primarily a research platform rather than a commercial product, its development has pushed the entire field of robotics forward. The technologies pioneered in Atlas are influencing the development of more practical robots for industrial, commercial, and potentially domestic applications, marking it as a true pioneer in the field of advanced robotics.</p>
