      <h1>Unimate - The Robot That Started It All</h1>
      <p>Industrial Robotics 1961</p>

        <p>Unimate was the world's first industrial robot. Weighing 4,000 pounds and controlled by a magnetic drum memory system, it was installed on a General Motors assembly line in Ewing Township, New Jersey, in 1961.</p>
        
        <p>Its job was simple but dangerous: to lift hot die-cast metal pieces from an assembly line and stack them. This single machine began a revolution that would transform global manufacturing forever.</p>

        <h1>Invention and Development</h1>
        <p>Unimate was based on the patent filed by inventor George Devol in 1954. He partnered with engineer Joseph Engelberger, who is often called "the father of robotics" for his successful business efforts to promote and sell the robot.</p>

          "I envisioned an automated device that would do the repetitive, unpleasant jobs that humans shouldn't have to do."
          <br>- George Devol, inventor
        </div>
        
        <p>The robot's arm could be programmed to perform a sequence of movements stored on a magnetic drum, and its hydraulic actuators gave it enough strength to handle heavy tasks with precision.</p>
        
        <h1>Impact on Industry</h1>
        <p>The installation at General Motors was a success. Unimate worked reliably, didn't take breaks, and wasn't at risk of injury from the dangerous task. Soon, companies across the automotive and manufacturing sectors began adopting robotic arms.</p>
        
        <p>This shift automated dangerous and monotonous jobs, dramatically increasing productivity and consistency while reshaping the nature of the industrial workforce. The descendants of Unimate's design are now found in factories all over the world.</p>

        <h1>Legacy</h1>
        <p>Unimate's legacy is immeasurable. It proved that robots could be practical, reliable tools in industry. It kicked off the field of industrial robotics, which has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "Without Unimate proving the concept, the entire landscape of modern manufacturing would look completely different. It is the ancestor of every robot on an assembly line today."
          <br>- Robotics Historian
        </div>
        
        <p>While not a "forgotten" hero in engineering circles, Unimate remains largely unknown to the public, despite being one of the most influential machines of the 20th century.</p>
