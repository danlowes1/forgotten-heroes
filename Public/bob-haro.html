        <h1>The Historic Moment</h1>
        <p>While there isn't one single moment like a game-winning goal, Bob Haro's "historic moment" was a series of creative breakthroughs. In the early 1980s, he performed and popularized tricks like the "bunny hop," "endo," and "tailwhip," which were entirely new concepts on a bicycle.</p>

          "Freestyle was a natural evolution. We were kids who loved to ride our bikes, and we started doing things on them that weren't for racing. We were just having fun and being creative."
