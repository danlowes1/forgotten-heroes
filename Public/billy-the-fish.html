                        Billy the Fish is one of Viz comic's most enduring and beloved characters, first appearing in the iconic British adult comic in the 1980s. He is the star goalkeeper for the perpetually struggling AFC Fulchester, a fictional football team that never seems to win a match without Billy's extraordinary interventions. Born to a Geordie fishmonger father and a mother who was, in fact, a haddock (she'd been caught off the Tyne during a particularly rough storm and, against all odds, survived the filleting process long enough to fall in love), Billy's piscine heritage grants him uncanny abilities on the pitch, such as flapping about in the goalmouth like a cod on a slab while somehow blocking shots that would baffle a human with actual arms.
                                His teammates, a motley crew of inept locals including the chain-smoking manager Grim Jim and the perennially injured striker Shakin' Stevens (no relation), rely on Billy's floundering saves to scrape through games, often against rivals like the posh lads from Poshchester United or the undead squad from Zombie Rovers. In one memorable strip, Billy heroically swallows the ball whole during a penalty shootout, only to regurgitate it into the opponent's net after a bout of indigestion brought on by pre-match kippers. Critics have hailed him as a metaphor for the working-class underdog, though really he's just a fish in shorts, proving that in British football, even the halibut can have its day.

                        What makes Billy unique is that he's literally a fish with human legs - a bizarre concept that perfectly 
                        captures the absurdist humor that made Viz famous. Despite his aquatic nature, Billy is an incredible 
                        goalkeeper, often saving the day with his fishy abilities.

                    <p class="hero-desc">
                        The character has become a cult favorite, representing the quintessential British humor that mixes 
                        football culture with surreal absurdity. His strips are filled with puns, visual gags, and the 
                        distinctive style that has kept Viz popular for decades.
