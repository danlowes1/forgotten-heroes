      <h1>Nancy Wake - The White Mouse Who Outwitted the Gestapo</h1>
      <p>Resistance Hero 1912-2011</p>

        <p>Nancy Grace Augusta Wake (30 August 1912 - 7 August 2011) was a New Zealand-born British secret agent and resistance fighter during World War II.</p>
        <p>She became one of the most decorated servicewomen of the war and was nicknamed "The White Mouse" by the Gestapo for her remarkable ability to evade capture. As one of the most successful resistance fighters in France, Wake led 7,000 Maquis troops in guerrilla warfare against German forces and was at the top of the Gestapo's most-wanted list.</p>

        <h1>The Formidable Resistance Fighter</h1>
        <p>After witnessing the rise of Nazism in Europe while working as a journalist in Vienna, Wake joined the French Resistance following Germany's invasion of France. She and her French husband, Henri Fiocca, helped Allied airmen and Jewish refugees escape France until Henri was captured, tortured, and executed by the Gestapo in 1943.</p>

          "I hate wars and violence, but if they come then I don't see why we women should just wave our men a proud goodbye and then knit them balaclavas."

        <p>After escaping to Britain, Wake joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and was parachuted back into France in 1944. She became a pivotal leader in the Maquis resistance, organizing arms drops, sabotaging German operations, and leading thousands of fighters. Her most famous feat was cycling 500 kilometers through multiple German checkpoints to replace lost codes, a journey that took her 72 hours.</p>
        
        <h1>Aftermath and Legacy</h1>
        <p>Wake was the Allies' most decorated servicewoman of WWII, receiving the George Medal (UK), Croix de guerre (France), Medal of Freedom (US), and being made a Companion of the Order of Australia. Despite her extraordinary contributions, she received no British gallantry medals during her lifetime, a source of lasting controversy.</p>
        
        <p>After the war, Wake worked for the British Intelligence Department at the Air Ministry and stood as a Liberal candidate in Australian elections. Her incredible story has been told in books, documentaries, and a miniseries, ensuring her legacy as one of history's most courageous and effective resistance fighters lives on.</p>
