      <h1>Desmond Doss - The Unarmed Savior of Hacksaw Ridge</h1>
      <p>World War II 1945</p>

        <p>Desmond Thomas Doss (February 7, 1919 - March 23, 2006) was a United States Army corporal who served as a combat medic during World War II. He was the first and only conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor for his incredible acts of bravery without ever firing a weapon.</p>
        
        <p>Driven by a deep personal faith that forbade him from killing or carrying a weapon, Doss entered the Battle of Okinawa and single-handedly saved the lives of an estimated 75 men over a grueling 12-hour period under constant enemy fire.</p>

        <h1>A Commitment to Peace</h1>
        <p>Doss was a devout Seventh-day Adventist who believed in the commandment "Thou shalt not kill." When he was drafted, he refused to claim a ministerial exemption but also refused to carry a weapon. He faced ridicule and abuse from his fellow soldiers, who saw him as a coward and a liability.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "While everybody else is taking life, I'm going to be saving it. With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together."
          <br>- Desmond Doss
        </div>
        
        <p>He persevered through the training, determined to serve his country as a medic. His company eventually came to respect his unwavering convictions and physical courage.</p>
        
        <h1>The Battle of Hacksaw Ridge</h1>
        <p>In May 1945, Doss's unit was tasked with capturing the Maeda Escarpment, a jagged cliff face nicknamed "Hacksaw Ridge." After a fierce assault, American soldiers were forced to retreat under heavy Japanese counter-attacks, leaving dozens of wounded men stranded on the battlefield.</p>
        
        <p>Doss alone remained. Under a hail of gunfire and artillery, he repeatedly ran into the kill zone to rescue his wounded comrades. One by one, he carried them to the edge of the cliff and lowered them down to safety on a rope-supported stretcher he had devised.</p>

        <h1>Legacy of Courage</h1>
        <p>Desmond Doss's actions at Hacksaw Ridge are among the most remarkable displays of bravery in military history. He was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman in 1945, who told him, "I'm proud of you. You really deserve this. I consider this a greater honor than being president."</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "He was one of the bravest persons alive and then to have him end up saving my life was everything to me. He saved 75 of us. Nobody else could have done what he did."
          <br>- Captain Jack Glover, Doss's commanding officer
        </div>
        
        <p>Doss's story redefines the meaning of heroism. It is not a story of inflicting violence, but of profound, self-sacrificing compassion in the face of unimaginable horror. He proved that the greatest strength can lie in the courage of one's convictions and an unwavering commitment to preserving life.</p>
