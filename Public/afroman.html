    <h1>Afroman - The Philosopher of Stoner Rap</h1>
    <p>Music 1974-Present</p>
    
    <p>Afroman (Joseph Foreman) is the cult-favorite rapper whose humorous, weed-infused storytelling created some of the most quotable lyrics in hip-hop history. Best known for his 2001 hit "Because I Got High", his music blends street wisdom with absurdist comedy, often overlooked by mainstream rap despite his lasting influence on stoner culture.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      Colt 45 and two zig zags, baby that's all we need<br>
      We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed
      <br>- Afroman, "Colt 45" (2000)

    <h2>Forgotten Lyricism</h2>
    <p>Beneath the party surface, Afroman's lyrics reveal surprising depth:</p>
    
    <h3>1. "Because I Got High" (2001)</h3>
    <p><em>"I was gonna clean my room until I got high<br>
    I was gonna get up and find the broom but then I got high<br>
    My room is still messed up and I know why (why man?)<br>
    Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high"</em></p>
    <p>A deceptively brilliant satire of addiction cycles, wrapped in a novelty hit.</p>
    
    <h3>2. "Crazy Rap" (2000)</h3>
    <p><em>"I live in the woods with my cousin named Sam<br>
    We got fake IDs and a beat-up old van<br>
    We play Nintendo and smoke a lil' grass<br>
    And drink Olde English until we fall on our ass"</em></p>
    <p>Blue-collar poetry that predates "trailer rap" by a decade.</p>
    
    <h3>3. "Palmdale" (2001)</h3>
    <p><em>"I left my wallet in El Segundo<br>
    I gotta get it, I got got to<br>
    It had my money, my bus pass<br>
    And the phone numbers of all the fine hos in the class"</em></p>
    <p>An epic stoner Odyssey about retracing your steps.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Was He Forgotten?</h2>
    <p>Several factors contributed to Afroman's cult status:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Novelty label:</strong> Critics dismissed him as a one-hit wonder</li>
      <li><strong>Independent hustle:</strong> Rejected major labels to keep creative control</li>
      <li><strong>No filter:</strong> Lyrics too raw for commercial rap's polished image</li>
      <li><strong>Weed culture:</strong> Mainstream hip-hop ignored stoner rap until recently</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Rediscovery and Legacy</h2>
    <p>In recent years, Afroman's influence has grown:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2008:</strong> "Because I Got High" added to the National Archives as cultural artifact</li>
      <li><strong>2016:</strong> Performed at Coachella's cannabis-themed stage</li>
      <li><strong>Influence:</strong> Paved way for artists like Lil Dicky and Yung Gravy</li>
      <li><strong>Modern parallels:</strong> His DIY approach mirrors SoundCloud rap's rise</li>
    </ul>
