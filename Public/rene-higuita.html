  <h1>René Higuita: El Loco and the Immortal Scorpion Kick</h1>
    <p>Sports Circa 1985 - 2010</p>

      <p>José René Higuita Zapata (born August 27, 1966) is a former Colombian professional goalkeeper who remains one of football's most eccentric and iconic figures. Nicknamed “El Loco” ("The Madman") by his Atlético Nacional manager and Colombia coach Francisco Maturana, Higuita was a pioneer of the "sweeper-keeper" role, redefining the position in the late 1980s and 1990s through his high-risk, dramatic playing style and flamboyant personality.</p>
      <p>Higuita's legacy rests on two pillars: his revolutionary approach to goalkeeping and the single most audacious save in football history—the Scorpion Kick.</p>

<h1>The Birth of the Sweeper-Keeper</h1>
      <p>Higuita, who started his football life as a striker before substituting for an injured player and converting to a goalkeeper, made his professional debut in 1985 with Los Millonarios in Bogotá. He moved to his hometown team, Atlético Nacional of Medellín, the following year. At Nacional, his coach Francisco Maturana encouraged him to roam beyond the goalkeeper’s box, stating that “with René as sweeper, we have 11 outfield players.”</p>

      <p>This approach made him a trailblazer, actively participating in build-up play, often leaving his area to dribble past opponents, launch attacks, and showcase daring composure under pressure—long before Manuel Neuer made the role mainstream. Higuita also became known for being a goal-scoring keeper, regularly taking penalties and free-kicks, accumulating 41 career goals (one of the highest tallies for a goalkeeper in history).</p>

      <h1>Club Success and World Cup Blunder</h1>
      <p>Higuita starred at Atlético Nacional for over a decade, helping the team secure their historic 1989 Copa Libertadores triumph—the first ever by a Colombian club. In the final, which went to a penalty shootout, Higuita was instrumental, making four saves and even scoring one penalty himself. The team also won the Colombian league (Categoría Primera A) in 1991 and 1994, and the Copa Interamericana in 1989.</p>
      <p>For the Colombian national team, Higuita was a central figure, making 68 appearances and scoring 3 goals between 1987 and 1999. His high-risk approach, however, led to his most famous error during the 1990 FIFA World Cup Round of 16 match against Cameroon. With Colombia narrowly trailing, Higuita attempted to dribble the ball far outside his area but was dispossessed by striker Roger Milla, who easily scored, resulting in Colombia's elimination. Higuita himself described the mistake as "as big as a house."</p>

      <h1>The Immortal Moment: The Scorpion Kick</h1>
      <p>Higuita's eternal place in football folklore was sealed during a seemingly meaningless friendly match between Colombia and England at Wembley Stadium on September 6, 1995. In a game that finished 0-0, debutant Jamie Redknapp launched an overhit cross towards the Colombian goal. Although the linesman had his flag raised for offside, Higuita chose not to simply catch the ball.</p>
      <p>Instead, he performed the "Scorpion Kick": leaping forward with his body parallel to the ground, arching his legs over his head, and kicking the ball away with his heels. This breath-taking, acrobatic save was a moment of sheer theatrical audacity, inspired, Higuita later explained, by watching children play football in the street. The move, which causes the body to resemble a scorpion with its stinger raised, instantly became a global sporting sensation, ranking highly in subsequent polls of great sporting moments.</p>

      <h1>Later Career and Personal Life</h1>
      <p>Higuita played for numerous clubs in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, and Spain throughout his career, which included a one-year loan to Real Valladolid in 1991 and stints at Independiente Medellín and Aucas. His professional career was often complicated by his personal life; most notably, he was imprisoned for seven months in 1993 after acting as a go-between in a kidnapping case involving drug barons Pablo Escobar and Carlos Molina, an act for which he received $64,000, violating Colombian law regarding profiting from kidnapping.</p>
      <p>He retired from playing professional football in 2010. In 2005, he participated in a reality TV program called *La Isla de Los famosos: Una Aventura Pirata* (similar to *Survivor*) and underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance. From 2012 to 2017, he worked as a goalkeeper coach for Al-Nassr FC in Saudi Arabia before returning to Atlético Nacional in the same role. His life was recently the subject of the 2023 Netflix documentary, *Higuita: El camino del Escorpión* (Higuita: The Way of the Scorpion).</p>
