      <h1>WABOT-1 - The Pioneer Humanoid Robot</h1>
      <p>Robotics 1973</p>

        <p>WABOT-1 (Waseda Robot-1) was the world's first full-scale anthropomorphic robot, built at Waseda University in Japan in 1973. This groundbreaking creation marked a significant milestone in humanoid robotics and set the stage for future developments in the field.</p>
        
        <p>Developed by a team led by Professor Ichiro Kato, WABOT-1 could walk, communicate in Japanese, grip objects, and measure distances to objects using external receptors. It represented a giant leap forward in robotics technology and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <h1>Development and Capabilities</h1>
        <p>The WABOT-1 project was initiated in 1970 at Waseda University's School of Science and Engineering. The robot consisted of a limb-control system, a vision system, and a conversation system.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "Our goal was to create a robot that could assist human beings in their daily activities. WABOT-1 was the first step toward that vision."
          <br>- Professor Ichiro Kato, project lead
        </div>
        
        <p>WABOT-1 had a relatively sophisticated system for its time. It could communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth capable of producing speech-like sounds. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, and it could grip and transport objects with hands that had tactile sensors.</p>
        
        <h1>Technical Specifications</h1>
        <p>WABOT-1 stood at approximately 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) tall and weighed around 130 kilograms (287 pounds). It featured:</p>
        
        <p>- Two arms with gripper-style hands capable of basic manipulation<br>
           - A vision system consisting of artificial eyes with photo-transistors<br>
           - Auditory sensors (microphones) for voice recognition<br>
           - A speech synthesis system for communication in Japanese<br>
           - A locomotion system that allowed for waling with a step time of about 45 seconds<br>
           - A control system that coordinated all these functions</p>

        <h1>Legacy and Impact</h1>
        <p>Though primitive by today's standards, WABOT-1 was a monumental achievement that demonstrated the feasibility of humanoid robots. It inspired countless researchers and engineers to pursue humanoid robotics.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "WABOT-1 was the proof of concept that showed humanoid robots were possible. Every humanoid robot today, from ASIMO to Atlas, owes something to this pioneering work."
          <br>- Robotics historian
        </div>
        
        <p>The project led to the development of WABOT-2 in the 1980s, which was even more advanced and could read musical scores and play electronic keyboards. The WABOT project established Japan as a leader in robotics research and development, a position it maintains to this day.</p>
        
        <p>WABOT-1's development represented a crucial moment when robotics moved beyond industrial arms and began to explore the much more complex challenge of creating machines in human form that could interact with human environments.</p>
