      <h1>The Severed Head Prop - Se7en's Unseen Horror</h1>
      <p>Film September 22, 1995</p>

        <p>In the annals of cinematic history, few props have achieved legendary status precisely because they were never used. The silicone replica of Gwyneth Paltrow's head, created for the climax of David Fincher's 1995 masterpiece "Se7en," is one such artifact.</p>
        
        <div class="image-placeholder">
          <!-- In a real implementation, you would have an actual image here -->
          <div style="background-color: #ddd; height: 315px; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0;">
            <p>[Image: The unused silicone head prop from Se7en]</p>
          </div>
          <p class="image-caption">A recreation of what the infamous unused prop might have looked like</p>
        </div>

        <p>Crafted by special effects artist Rob Bottin, the hyper-realistic head was designed for the film's infamous "What's in the box?" scene. The prop featured intricate details including lifelike skin texture, glass eyes, and even simulated blood and trauma.</p>
        
        <h1>The Decision That Heightened the Horror</h1>
        <p>Despite the incredible craftsmanship, Brad Pitt—who played Detective Mills—argued that showing the head would diminish the psychological impact of the scene. He believed the audience's imagination would conjure something far more terrifying than any physical prop could represent.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "The power of the film is that you don't see it. What you imagine is so much worse."
          <br>- David Fincher on the decision not to show the head
        </div>
        
        <p>Director David Fincher ultimately agreed, and the explicit shot of the severed head was cut from the film. Instead, he chose to focus on Brad Pitt's horrified reaction, allowing viewers to imagine the gruesome contents of the box for themselves.</p>
        
        <h1>From Prop to Legend</h1>
        <p>After the film's release, the meticulously crafted prop was stored away and largely forgotten until it resurfaced in interviews and behind-the-scenes features years later. It has since become a cult object among film enthusiasts—a literal "forgotten legend" that represents a pivotal creative decision in one of cinema's most memorable endings.</p>
        
        <p>The head's existence but absence from the final film created a meta-narrative that perfectly complements the themes of "Se7en": sometimes what we don't see is more powerful than what we do, and some horrors are best left to the imagination.</p>
