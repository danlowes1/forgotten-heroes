        <p>George is a British humanoid robot created by engineer and computer historian Tony Sale in 1949. Standing around six feet tall, George was assembled from scrap metals salvaged from a crashed RAF Wellington bomber, a testament to post-war ingenuity and the DIY spirit that defined early robotics. Sale built George for about £15, giving the machine a striking aluminium and duralumin body that looked both industrial and uncannily human.</p>

        <p>Far more than a static showpiece, George could walk, turn his head, move his arms, sit down, and even waggle a jaw to “speak,” all powered by a pair of motorcycle batteries in his chest and controlled by radio remote. He was demonstrated publicly at RAF Debden open days and appeared on television, where his purposeful gait and turning head made him a minor celebrity of British post-war tech culture.</p>

        <h1>Origins and build</h1>
        <p>Sale’s early fascination with robotics led him to create several “George” prototypes before this surviving version—effectively George Mark IV—constructed when he joined the Royal Air Force as a radar instructor at RAF Debden in Essex. The surviving George’s frame and panels were fashioned from recycled aircraft materials, yielding a durable, lightweight shell that could house motors, linkages, and batteries without weighing the robot down excessively.</p>

        <p>Newsreel coverage captured George’s capabilities for a wider audience, showing the robot walking, turning, and performing basic motions under radio control. Contemporary documentation and archives note British Pathé footage and open-day demonstrations that helped cement George’s status as an early, memorable humanoid in the UK’s technology heritage.</p>

        <h1>Capabilities and character</h1>

          <br>- Early reports on George
        </div>
        <p>George’s motion repertoire—walking, head-turning, arm movement, seated posture—and the articulating jaw gave him a lifelike presence unusual for the era. His radio remote allowed Sale to choreograph movements, while the internal batteries provided untethered operation, a crucial factor in convincing audiences they were witnessing an autonomous humanoid rather than a wired prop.</p>

        <p>That blend of recycled aviation materials and humanlike motion produced a visual identity: a metallic figure with broad shoulders, distinctive feet, and a faceplate that could “talk.” Seen alongside contemporaneous machines, George’s humanoid silhouette felt relatable, helping audiences project personality onto the robot and pushing the line between mechanism and companion.</p>

        <h1>Dormancy and revival</h1>
        <p>After decades of inactivity—stored in Sale’s garage—George was reawakened in November 2010. Sale oiled bearings, replaced the original motorcycle batteries with modern lithium batteries housed in the legs, and switched him on: “away he went.” The revival drew international media attention and featured in Wallace and Gromit’s World of Invention, bringing George back into public view after roughly 45 years of silence.</p>

        <p>Following the successful revival, Sale donated George to The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, where he has been displayed to the public. The museum context—alongside computing history such as the Colossus rebuild that Sale led—situates George within a broader narrative of British innovation from wartime engineering to modern computing and robotics.</p>

        <h1>Legacy and exhibitions</h1>
        <p>George’s significance lies in his timing and construction: a humanoid robot built from the detritus of war, animated by practical electronics, and shown to the public as a vision of technology’s human-facing future. His touring appearances have included a Science Museum-led exhibition on the centuries-long quest to build humanoid robots, marking George not just as a curiosity but as a milestone in the cultural history of machines that move like us.</p>

        <p>Today, George is remembered as a pioneering British humanoid and a forerunner to the public-facing robots that would follow, embodying a bridge between improvised post-war engineering and the modern fascination with anthropomorphic machines. His survival, revival, and continued exhibition make him a compelling chapter in the story of how we imagined—and built—robots to share our spaces.</p>
