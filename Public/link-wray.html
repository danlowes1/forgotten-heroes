      <h1>Link Wray - The Godfather of the Power Chord</h1>
      <p>Music 1958-2005</p>

        <p>Fred Lincoln "Link" Wray Jr. (May 2, 1929 â€“ November 5, 2005) was an American rock and roll guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist who became popular in the late 1950s.</p>
        
        <p>Wray is best known for pioneering the electric guitar power chord, a foundational element of rock, punk, and heavy metal music. His 1958 instrumental hit "Rumble" is widely regarded as a turning point in electric guitar technique.</p>

        <h1>The Rumble Heard Around the World</h1>
        <p>In 1958, while trying to work out a sound for a live performance, Wray poked holes in his amplifier speakers to create the distorted, gritty tone that would become his signature sound. This innovation led to his breakthrough hit "Rumble."</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "I was the first guy to play the power chord. I didn't even know what it was called. I just knew I liked how it sounded."
          <br>- Link Wray
        </div>
        
        <p>Remarkably, "Rumble" was banned from some radio stations for fear its title and aggressive sound would incite teenage gang violence. This only increased its appeal, making it a surprise hit that reached No. 16 on the Billboard charts.</p>
        
        <h1>Influence on Rock Music</h1>
        <p>Wray's raw, distorted guitar sound was revolutionary at a time when clean, polished production dominated popular music. His aggressive approach to the electric guitar paved the way for hard rock, heavy metal, punk, and garage rock.</p>
        
        <p>Pete Townshend of The Who famously credited Wray as the inspiration for his power chord-driven style, saying "He is the king; if it hadn't been for Link Wray and 'Rumble,' I would have never picked up a guitar."</p>

        <h1>Later Career and Legacy</h1>
        <p>Despite his early influence, Wray never achieved major commercial success. He continued recording and performing through the decades, experimenting with different styles while maintaining his raw, minimalist approach to the guitar.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "Link Wray is the foundation of dirty guitar. Without him, I wouldn't be playing the way I do."
          <br>- Neil Young
        </div>
        
        <p>Wray's influence can be heard in the work of countless guitarists, from Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page to Iggy Pop and Bob Dylan. He was ranked No. 45 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, a testament to his enduring impact on rock music.</p>
