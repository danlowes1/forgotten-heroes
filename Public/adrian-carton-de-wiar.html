      <p>Military History 1880-1963</p>

        <p>Lieutenant General Sir Adrian Paul Ghislain Carton de Wiart (5 May 1880 - 5 June 1963) was a British Army officer of Belgian and Irish descent.</p>
        <p>He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration for valour "in the face of the enemy" in various Commonwealth countries. He served in the Boer War, First World War and Second World War. He was shot in the face, head, stomach, groin, ankle, leg, hip and ear; was blinded in his left eye; survived two plane crashes; tunneled out of a prisoner-of-war camp; and tore off his own fingers when a doctor declined to amputate them. Describing his experiences in the First World War, he wrote, "Frankly, I had enjoyed the war."</p>

        <h1>Early Life and Background</h1>
        <p>Carton de Wiart was born into an aristocratic family in Brussels on 5 May 1880, as the eldest son of Léon Constant Ghislain Carton de Wiart, a lawyer and magistrate, and Ernestine Wenzig. He spent his early days in Belgium and England before his father moved the family to Cairo. He was a Roman Catholic and attended the Roman Catholic Oratory School in England before going to Balliol College, Oxford. He left university to join the British Army, falsifying his name and age to sign up as "Trooper Carton" in Paget's Horse during the Second Boer War.</p>

        <h1>Military Career</h1>
        <p>Carton de Wiart was wounded in the stomach and groin in South Africa early in the Second Boer War and was invalided home. After recovering, he was given a regular commission as a second lieutenant in the 4th Dragoon Guards and transferred to India in 1902. He was promoted to captain in 1910 and served as adjutant for the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars from 1912.</p>

        <h1>First World War</h1>
        <p>When the First World War broke out, Carton de Wiart was en route to British Somaliland where he was seconded to the Somaliland Camel Corps. In an attack on an enemy fort at Shimber Berris, he was shot twice in the face, losing his eye and a portion of his ear, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.</p>
        
        <p>He went on to serve on the Western Front, commanding three infantry battalions and a brigade. He was wounded seven more times in the war, losing his left hand in 1915 when he tore off his own fingers after a doctor declined to amputate them. He was shot through the skull and ankle at the Battle of the Somme, through the hip at Passchendaele, through the leg at Cambrai, and through the ear at Arras.</p>

        <h1>Victoria Cross Action</h1>
        <p>Carton de Wiart received the Victoria Cross in 1916 for his actions on 2-3 July during the Battle of the Somme at La Boiselle, France. The citation praised his "most conspicuous bravery, coolness and determination during severe operations of a prolonged nature." It noted that "it was owing in a great measure to his dauntless courage and inspiring example that a serious reverse was averted" and that "he displayed the utmost energy and courage in forcing our attack home."</p>

          "Frankly, I had enjoyed the war. It had given me many bad moments, but it had given me many fine ones too."
          <br>- Lieutenant General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart
        </div>

        <h1>Interwar Years and Poland</h1>
        <p>After the war, Carton de Wiart was sent to Poland as part of the British-Poland Military Mission, eventually becoming its head. He developed strong sympathy for the Polish cause and supported their claims to eastern Galicia. He became close to Polish leader Marshal Józef Piłsudski and was active during the Polish-Soviet War when the Red Army threatened Warsaw in 1920.</p>

        <p>He officially retired from the army in 1923 but remained in Poland, where he was given use of a large estate called Prostyń in the Pripet Marshes. He spent 15 years there, hunting and enjoying country life until recalled in 1939 as head of the British Military Mission to Poland as war loomed.</p>

        <h1>Second World War</h1>
        <p>During the German invasion of Poland, Carton de Wiart evacuated the British Mission from Warsaw along with the Polish government. He narrowly escaped capture by using a false passport to fly out of Romania just before the pro-Allied prime minister was assassinated.</p>

        <p>In 1940, he commanded the Anglo-French force at Namsos during the Norwegian Campaign. Later that year, he was appointed head of the British-Yugoslavian Military Mission. While flying to Belgrade, his plane crash-landed off the coast of Italian-controlled Libya, and he was captured by Italian authorities.</p>

        <p>As a high-profile prisoner, he was held at Castello di Vincigliata where he made five escape attempts, including seven months of tunneling. In 1943, he was taken to Rome to help negotiate Italy's surrender with the Allies. He was released and made his way to England in August 1943.</p>

        <p>Churchill then sent him to China as his personal representative to Chiang Kai-shek. He attended the 1943 Cairo Conference and spent three years in Chongqing performing diplomatic duties. He became a great admirer of the Chinese people and was involved in reporting on the growing power of Chinese Communists.</p>

        <h1>Later Life and Legacy</h1>
        <p>Carton de Wiart retired in October 1947. En route home, he stopped in Rangoon where he slipped on coconut matting, broke several vertebrae, and was hospitalized. His first wife died in 1949, and in 1951 he married Ruth Myrtle Muriel Joan McKechnie (Joan Sutherland). They settled at Aghinagh House in County Cork, Ireland, where he died on 5 June 1963 at age 83.</p>

        <p>Carton de Wiart was thought to be a model for the character of Brigadier Ben Ritchie-Hook in Evelyn Waugh's trilogy Sword of Honour. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography described him: "With his black eyepatch and empty sleeve, Carton de Wiart looked like an elegant pirate, and became a figure of legend." His autobiography, Happy Odyssey, remains a classic account of his extraordinary military career.</p>
