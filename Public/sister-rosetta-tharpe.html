      <h1>Sister Rosetta Tharpe - The Godmother of Rock &amp; Roll</h1>
      <p>Music 1938-1973</p>

        <p>Rosetta Nubin (March 20, 1915 â€“ October 9, 1973), known as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and recording artist.</p>
        
        <p>She attained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s with her gospel recordings that were a unique mixture of spiritual lyrics and rhythmic accompaniment that was a precursor of rock and roll.</p>

        <h1>Blending Sacred and Secular</h1>
        <p>Tharpe was a pioneer in her guitar technique, her loud amplification, and her blending of spiritual lyrics with secular-sounding music. She was one of the first recording artists to use heavy distortion on her electric guitar, creating a prototype for the rock sound that would emerge decades later.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "She was ahead of her time, doing things nobody else was doing. She was rock and roll before there was rock and roll."
          <br>- Gospel singer Marie Knight
        </div>
        
        <p>In 1938, at just 23 years old, she recorded four songs for Decca Records, including "Rock Me," which featured her distinctive guitar style and vocal delivery. These recordings were among the first gospel records to cross over into the popular market.</p>
        
        <h1>Influence on Rock Pioneers</h1>
        <p>Tharpe's musical style influenced numerous early rock-and-roll performers, including Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and Jerry Lee Lewis.</p>
        
        <p>Little Richard called Tharpe his favorite singer when he was a child. In 1947, she heard the young Richard singing before her concert at the Macon City Auditorium and invited him to open her show, which marked his first public performance outside of the church.</p>

        <h1>Rediscovery and Legacy</h1>
        <p>Despite her early success, Tharpe's popularity waned in the 1950s as gospel music became more traditional and rock and roll emerged. She continued performing in Europe, where she developed a strong following, but was largely forgotten in the United States.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "That's where rock and roll came from - from the church. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was rock and roll before anybody thought about it."
          <br>- Ira Tucker of the Dixie Hummingbirds
        </div>
        
        <p>In recent years, Tharpe has been recognized for her pioneering role in music history. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018 as an Early Influence, and her contribution to music has been celebrated in documentaries and tribute albums.</p>
