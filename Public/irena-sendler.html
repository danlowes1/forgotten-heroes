      <h1>Irena Sendler - The Woman Who Smuggled 2,500 Children to Safety</h1>
      <p>World War II 1939-1945</p>

        <p>Irena Sendler (née Krzyżanowska, 15 February 1910 – 12 May 2008) was a Polish humanitarian and social worker who served in the Polish Underground Resistance during World War II in German-occupied Warsaw.</p>
        
        <p>As head of the children's section of Żegota (the Council to Aid Jews), she and her network of collaborators smuggled approximately 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto, providing them with false identities and sheltering them with adoptive families, orphanages, and convents.</p>

        <h1>The Network of Life</h1>
        <p>Using her papers as a social worker with access to the Ghetto, Sendler and her team created ingenious methods to smuggle children past Nazi guards. Infants were sedated and hidden in toolboxes, luggage, or sacks. Older children were led through secret passages in courthouses or sewers.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          I was taught by my father that when someone is drowning, you must give them your hand. The world may be divided by race, nation, and religion, but humanity must be united.
          <br>- Irena Sendler

        <p>Every child rescued was recorded on thin strips of paper, which she buried in jars under an apple tree in a friend's yard. She did this so that, after the war, the children could be reunited with their families—though tragically, almost all of their parents perished in the Treblinka extermination camp.</p>
        
        <h1>Capture and Torture</h1>
        <p>In 1943, the Gestapo discovered Sendler's activities. She was arrested, imprisoned, and brutally tortured at Pawiak prison. Despite having her legs and feet broken, she refused to betray her colleagues or the identities of the saved children. She was sentenced to death.</p>
        
        <p>Żegota managed to save her at the last minute by bribing German guards on the way to her execution. She was left in the woods, unconscious and with broken limbs, but alive. For the remainder of the war, she lived in hiding, continuing her work under a false name.</p>

        <h1>A Quiet Hero</h1>
        <p>After the war, Sendler was persecuted by Poland's communist authorities for her ties to the Polish Underground. Her story remained largely unknown for decades until four American high school students from Kansas rediscovered her history in 1999 and wrote a play about her life, "Life in a Jar," which brought her heroism to global attention.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "Heroes do extraordinary things. What I did was not extraordinary; it was a normal thing to do. You must understand that for me, it was an need of my heart."
          <br>- Irena Sendler
        </div>
        
        <p>Irena Sendler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. She represents the countless ordinary people who, at immense personal risk, chose to stand against overwhelming evil with simple, profound acts of courage and kindness. She passed away in 2008, a true forgotten hero whose legacy is one of unwavering humanity.</p>
