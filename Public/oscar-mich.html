    <h1>Oscar Micheaux - The Rebel Filmmaker Who Defied Hollywood</h1>
    <p>Film 1884-1951</p>
    
    <p>Oscar Micheaux was the first major African-American filmmaker, producing and directing over 44 feature films between 1919 and 1948 at a time when Black faces were rarely seen on screen except as stereotypes. As an independent director, he created "race films" that presented Black characters with dignity and complexity, directly challenging the racist portrayals common in Hollywood.</p>

    <h2>The Original Independent Filmmaker</h2>
    <p>Micheaux's career was marked by relentless determination:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Self-funded</strong> his first film by selling shares door-to-door to Black farmers</li>
      <li><strong>Wrote, produced and distributed</strong> all his own films</li>
      <li><strong>Bypassed white studios</strong> to take films directly to Black audiences</li>
      <li><strong>First Black filmmaker</strong> to produce a feature-length talkie (<em>The Exile</em>, 1931)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Was He Forgotten?</h2>
    <p>Several factors contributed to Micheaux's obscurity after his death:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Film preservation neglect:</strong> Only about 15 of his 44 films survive today</li>
      <li><strong>Segregated cinema:</strong> His films weren't reviewed in mainstream press</li>
      <li><strong>Low budgets:</strong> Technical limitations made later critics dismiss his work</li>
      <li><strong>Hollywood erasure:</strong> The studio system ignored independent Black filmmakers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Rediscovery and Legacy</h2>
    <p>In recent decades, Micheaux has been recognized as a visionary:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1986:</strong> Received posthumous Golden Jubilee Special Directorial Award from the Directors Guild</li>
      <li><strong>2010:</strong> Inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame</li>
      <li><strong>Influence:</strong> Inspired Spike Lee, John Singleton, and the Blaxploitation movement</li>
      <li><strong>Modern parallels:</strong> His DIY approach predates today's independent film scene</li>
    </ul>
