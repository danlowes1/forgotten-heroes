      <h1>John "Jack" Churchill - The Sword-Wielding Madman of WWII</h1>
      <p>Military Hero 1906-1996</p>

        <p>Lieutenant Colonel John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming Churchill (16 September 1906 â€“ 8 March 1996) was a British Army officer who fought throughout WWII armed with a longbow, arrows, and a Scottish broadsword.</p>
        <p>Nicknamed "Fighting Jack Churchill" and "Mad Jack," he is known for his motto: "Any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly dressed." Churchill became the only British soldier known to have felled an enemy with a longbow in WWII during the Battle of l'Epinette in France.</p>

        <h1>Unconventional Warfare</h1>
        <p>Churchill was a man seemingly born in the wrong century. Between the wars, he represented Britain in the World Archery Championships and appeared in several films as an archer. When WWII broke out, he immediately reported for duty with his trademark longbow and broadsword.</p>

        <p>During the Dunkirk evacuation, Churchill covered the retreat of his regiment by taking out a German sergeant with his longbow. He later led commando raids in Norway and Italy, where he captured 42 German soldiers and a mortar crew using only his sword, with his commandos claiming he'd simply scared them into surrendering.</p>
        
        <h1>Capture and Later Life</h1>
        <p>Churchill was captured in Yugoslavia in 1944 while leading a raid but escaped from a concentration camp, eventually walking 150 miles to meet up with American forces. He was sent to the Pacific theater but arrived just after the atomic bombs had been dropped, quipping that "If it wasn't for those damn Yanks, we could have kept the war going another 10 years!"</p>
        
        <p>After the war, he continued his unconventional career as a parachutist, surf enthusiast (he helped pioneer Australia's surf culture), and railway executive. Churchill remains one of WWII's most colorful and genuinely heroic figures, embodying British eccentricity and courage in equal measure.</p>
