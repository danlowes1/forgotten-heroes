      <h1>Jarvis Cocker - Stage Invader Who Stood Up to Michael Jackson</h1>
      <p>Music February 20, 1996</p>

        <p>Jarvis Cocker (born 19 September 1963) is an English musician and frontman of the band Pulp.</p>
        <p>He is chiefly remembered for his stage invasion during Michael Jackson's performance at the 1996 Brit Awards, where he disrupted Jackson's messianic performance in protest against what he perceived as Jackson's inappropriate and egotistical display. Cocker's act of protest against the "King of Pop" - who had a strange and controversial relationship with children - made him an instant counter-cultural hero.</p>

        <h1>The Historic Protest</h1>
        <p>On February 20, 1996, Michael Jackson performed at the Brit Awards in a grandiose, messianic style, surrounded by children and portraying himself as a Christ-like figure while singing "Earth Song."</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
          "He was pretending to be Christ-like, and there were kids dancing around him. I thought, 'This is not right.' It was a disgrace."
          <br>- Jarvis Cocker
        </div>
        
        <p>As most of us would probably do nowadays without thinking, ahead of his time Mr Cocker stormed the stage, waving his backside at Jackson in protest against what he saw as Jackson's inappropriate and egotistical performance, particularly given the serious child abuse allegations surrounding the star.</p>
        
        <h1>Aftermath and Legacy</h1>
        <p>Cocker's protest made him an instant counter-cultural hero who had the courage to say what many were thinking about Jackson's bizarre performance and questionable behavior with children. He was briefly arrested but released without charges.</p>
        
        <p>The incident has been remembered as a bold stand against celebrity worship and a powerful statement about holding even the biggest stars accountable for their actions. Cocker's act of defiance resonated with those who believed Jackson's behavior with children was deeply inappropriate and that his messianic performance crossed ethical boundaries.</p>
